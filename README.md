## Introduction
Food recognition is a challenging task in computer vision due to the wide variety of food items and their visual complexities. This project implements a deep learning-based approach to classify food items present in images. The model can be trained on a custom dataset or fine-tuned on existing pre-trained models for improved accuracy.

## Features
- Deep learning-based food recognition
- Support for custom datasets
- Integration with popular deep learning frameworks
- Image preprocessing for improved model performance
- Model evaluation and testing

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (choose one)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- sklearn
- (Add any other dependencies as needed)
